# Multi-Repo Coordination with Polygraph

**IMPORTANT:** NEVER `cd` into cloned repositories or access their files directly. ALWAYS use the `polygraph_delegate` tool to perform work in other repositories.

This skill provides guidance for working on features that span multiple repositories using Polygraph for coordination.

## Available Tools

Polygraph functionality is available via both MCP tools and CLI commands. Use whichever is available in your current environment.

| MCP Tool | CLI Equivalent | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `polygraph_candidates` | `polygraph-cli repo list` | Discover candidate workspaces with descriptions and graph relationships |
| `polygraph_init` | `polygraph-cli session start --repo <ids>` | Initialize a Polygraph session with selected workspaces |
| `polygraph_delegate` | — | Start a task in a child agent in another repository (non-blocking) |
| `polygraph_child_status` | — | Get the status and recent output of child agents |
| `polygraph_stop_child` | — | Stop an in-progress child agent |
| `polygraph_push_branch` | — | Push a local git branch to the remote repository |
| `polygraph_create_prs` | — | Create draft PRs with session metadata linking related PRs |
| `polygraph_get_session` | `polygraph-cli session status <id>` | Query status of the current session |
| `polygraph_mark_ready` | — | Mark draft PRs as ready for review |
| `polygraph_associate_pr` | — | Associate an existing PR with a session |
| `polygraph_modify_session` | `polygraph-cli session complete <id>` | Modify or complete a session (complete closes all PRs and seals it) |
| `ci_get_logs` | — | Retrieve full plain-text log for a specific CI job |
| — | `polygraph-cli login [--token]` | Authenticate with Nx Cloud (use `--token` for headless/CI) |
| — | `polygraph-cli session list` | List all sessions |
| — | `polygraph-cli org list` / `org select` | Organization management |
| — | `polygraph-cli whoami` | Show current auth status and org |

{%- if has_subagents %}

**Delegation rules:** `polygraph_candidates` and `polygraph_init` MUST be called via the `polygraph-init-subagent` as described in step 0. `polygraph_delegate` and `polygraph_child_status` MUST ALWAYS be called via background Task subagents (`run_in_background: true`) as described in step 1 — NEVER call them directly in the main conversation.
{%- endif %}

## CLI Statefulness

The Polygraph CLI (`polygraph-cli`) is **stateful**. When you select an organization — via `polygraph-cli org select` or the equivalent MCP tool — that selection is saved globally and all subsequent CLI commands and MCP tool calls operate against it. You do not need to pass the org on every command.

## Setup

Before using Polygraph tools, ensure the CLI is authenticated and an organization is selected.

### Check Authentication

Use `polygraph-cli whoami` (or the `whoami` MCP tool) to check if the user is currently logged in and which organization is active.

- If the user **is logged in** and an org is selected → proceed to the workflow.
- If the user **is not logged in** → use `polygraph-cli login` (or the `login` MCP tool) to authenticate. After login, an organization must be selected.

### Select Organization

After logging in (or if logged in but no org is selected), use `polygraph-cli org select` (or the equivalent MCP tool) to choose the organization that future commands will run against.

## Workflow Overview

{%- if has_subagents %}

0. **Initialize or join Polygraph session** - If you already have a session ID, call `polygraph_get_session` to fetch details. Otherwise, launch the `polygraph-init-subagent` to discover candidate repos, select relevant workspaces, and create a new session.
1. **Delegate work to each repo** - Use the `polygraph-delegate-subagent` to start child agents in other repositories.

2. **Initialize or join Polygraph session** - If you already have a session ID, call `polygraph_get_session` to fetch details. Otherwise, discover candidate repos, select relevant workspaces, and create a new session via `polygraph_candidates` and `polygraph_init`.
3. **Delegate work to each repo** - Use `polygraph_delegate` to start child agents in other repositories (returns immediately).
   {%- endif %}
4. **Monitor child agents** - Use `polygraph_child_status` to poll progress and get output from child agents.
5. **Stop child agents** (if needed) - Use `polygraph_stop_child` to cancel an in-progress child agent.
6. **Push branches** - Use `polygraph_push_branch` after making commits.
7. **Create draft PRs** - Use `polygraph_create_prs` to create linked draft PRs. Both `plan` and `agentSessionId` are required.
8. **Associate existing PRs** (optional) - Use `polygraph_associate_pr` to link PRs created outside Polygraph.
9. **Query PR status** - Use `polygraph_get_session` to check progress.
10. **Mark PRs ready** - Use `polygraph_mark_ready` when work is complete.
11. **Complete session** - Use `polygraph_modify_session` with `complete: true` to mark the session as completed when the user requests it.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 0. Initialize or Join Polygraph Session

**If you already have a session ID** (e.g., passed by the user or provided when Claude was spawned inside an existing session), the session already exists — do NOT create a new one. Instead, call `polygraph_get_session` to fetch the session details and skip straight to printing the session details below.

{%- if has_subagents %}

**If you need to create a new session**, use the `polygraph-init-subagent` to discover candidate repos, select relevant workspaces, and initialize the Polygraph session. The subagent handles calling `polygraph_candidates` and `polygraph_init` and returns a structured summary.
{%- else %}

**If you need to create a new session**, discover candidate repos using `polygraph_candidates`, select relevant workspaces, and initialize the Polygraph session using `polygraph_init`.
{%- endif %}

**Session ID is auto-generated:**

The `polygraph_init` tool automatically generates a unique session ID. You do NOT need to pass a session ID when creating a new session.
{%- if platform == "claude" %}

**Launch the init subagent** (only when creating a new session):

{% raw %}

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "polygraph-init-subagent",
  description: "Init Polygraph session",
  prompt: """
    Parameters:
    - userContext: "<description of what the user wants to do>"

    Discover candidates, select relevant repos based on the user context, initialize the session, and return a structured summary.
  """
)
```

{% endraw %}
{%- elsif platform == "opencode" %}

**Launch the init subagent** using `@polygraph-init-subagent` (only when creating a new session):

Invoke the `polygraph-init-subagent` agent with the user context. The subagent handles calling `polygraph_candidates` and `polygraph_init` and returns a structured summary.
{%- else %}

Call `polygraph_candidates` to discover available workspaces, select relevant repos based on user context, then call `polygraph_init` with the selected workspace IDs.
{%- endif %}

The subagent will:

1. Call `polygraph_candidates` to discover available workspaces
2. Select relevant repos based on the user context (or include all if uncertain)
3. Call `polygraph_init` with the selected workspace IDs
4. Call `polygraph_get_session` to retrieve session details
5. Return a summary with session URL, repos, and workspace info

**After receiving the subagent's summary (or after calling `polygraph_get_session` for an existing session), print the session details:**

**Session:** POLYGRAPH_SESSION_URL

**Repositories in this session:**

| Repo           | Local Path |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| REPO_FULL_NAME | LOCAL_PATH |

- REPO_FULL_NAME: from `workspaces[].vcsConfiguration.repositoryFullName`
- LOCAL_PATH: the absolute path to the local clone of the repo. If you started the session from within a repo, that repo's path is the current working directory. All other repos' paths are available from `polygraph_child_status`.
- POLYGRAPH_SESSION_URL: from `polygraphSessionUrl`

### 1. Delegate Work to Each Repository

{%- if platform == "claude" %}

**CRITICAL:** `polygraph_delegate` and `polygraph_child_status` MUST ALWAYS be called via background Task subagents (`run_in_background: true`), NEVER directly from the main conversation. Direct calls flood the context window with polling noise and degrade the user experience. This is a hard requirement, not a suggestion.

To delegate work to another repository, use the `Task` tool with `run_in_background: true` to launch a **background subagent** that handles the entire delegate-and-poll cycle. This keeps the noisy polling output hidden from the user — they only see a clean summary when the work completes.

**How it works:**

1. You launch a background `Task` subagent for each target repo
2. The subagent calls `polygraph_delegate` to start the child agent, then polls `polygraph_child_status` with backoff until completion
3. The subagent returns a summary of what happened
4. You can check progress anytime by reading the subagent's output file

**Launch a background subagent per repo** using the `polygraph-delegate-subagent`:

{% raw %}

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "polygraph-delegate-subagent",
  run_in_background: true,
  description: "Delegate to <repo-name>",
  prompt: """
    Parameters:
    - sessionId: "<session-id>"
    - target: "<org/repo-name>"
    - instruction: "<the task instruction>"
    - context: "<optional context>"

    Delegate the work, poll for completion, and return a structured summary.
  """
)
```

{% endraw %}

**Delegate to multiple repos in parallel** by launching multiple background Task subagents at the same time:

{% raw %}

```
// Launch subagents for each repo — all return immediately
Task(run_in_background: true, ..., prompt: "...delegate to frontend...")
Task(run_in_background: true, ..., prompt: "...delegate to backend...")

// Check progress later by reading the output files
Read(output_file_from_task_1)
Read(output_file_from_task_2)
```

{% endraw %}

You MUST ALWAYS use background Task subagents for delegation. NEVER call `polygraph_delegate` or `polygraph_child_status` directly in the main conversation — doing so floods the context window with polling output.

### 1a. Check on Background Subagents

Since delegation runs in background Task subagents, you can check progress by reading the output file returned when the Task was launched:

{% raw %}

```
Read(output_file_path)
```

{% endraw %}

Or use Bash to see recent output:

{% raw %}

```
Bash("tail -50 <output_file_path>")
```

{% endraw %}

In rare cases where you need to check the raw child agent status directly (e.g., debugging a stuck subagent), you may call `polygraph_child_status` as a one-off tool call. Do NOT use this for regular polling — that MUST happen in background subagents:

{% raw %}

```
polygraph_child_status(sessionId: "<session-id>", target: "org/repo-name", tail: 5)
```

{% endraw %}

Always verify all background subagents have completed before proceeding to push branches and create PRs.
{%- elsif platform == "opencode" %}

**CRITICAL:** `polygraph_delegate` and `polygraph_child_status` MUST ALWAYS be called via `@polygraph-delegate-subagent`, NEVER directly from the main conversation. Direct calls flood the context window with polling noise and degrade the user experience. This is a hard requirement, not a suggestion.

Use the `polygraph-delegate-subagent` agent (`@polygraph-delegate-subagent`) for each target repository. The subagent handles calling `polygraph_delegate` to start the child agent, then polls `polygraph_child_status` with backoff until completion, and returns a structured summary.

**For each target repo**, invoke `@polygraph-delegate-subagent` with:

- `sessionId`: The Polygraph session ID
- `target`: Repository name (e.g., `org/repo-name`)
- `instruction`: The task instruction for the child agent
- `context`: Optional additional context

**Delegate to multiple repos** by launching multiple `@polygraph-delegate-subagent` invocations.

### 1a. Check on Child Agents

Use `polygraph_child_status` to check progress:
{%- else %}

Use `polygraph_delegate` to start a child agent in each target repository. The call returns immediately — use `polygraph_child_status` to poll for completion with backoff.

**For each target repo:**

1. Call `polygraph_delegate` with `sessionId`, `target`, and `instruction`
2. Poll `polygraph_child_status` periodically until the child agent completes
3. Review the child agent's output before proceeding

**Delegate to multiple repos** by calling `polygraph_delegate` for each repo, then polling their status.

### 1a. Check on Child Agents

Use `polygraph_child_status` to check progress:

{% raw %}

```
polygraph_child_status(sessionId: "<session-id>", target: "org/repo-name", tail: 5)
```

{% endraw %}

Always verify all child agents have completed before proceeding to push branches and create PRs.
{%- endif %}

### 1b. Stop an In-Progress Child Agent

Use `polygraph_stop_child` to cancel an in-progress child agent. Use this if a child agent is stuck, taking too long, or if you need to cancel delegated work.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID
- `target` (required): Repository name or workspace ID of the child agent to stop

```
polygraph_stop_child(sessionId: "<session-id>", target: "org/repo-name")
```

**After stopping a child agent**, always print instructions for the user to continue work manually in the child repo. Get the repo path from the `cwd` field in the `system` init log entry (available via `polygraph_child_status`).

Display:

```
Child agent for <repo> has been cancelled.

To continue the work manually, run:
  cd <path> && claude --continue
```

Where `<path>` is the absolute path to the child repo clone (e.g., `/var/folders/.../polygraph/<session-id>/<repo>`).

### 2. Push Branches

Once work is complete in a repository, push the branch using `polygraph_push_branch`. This must be done before creating a PR.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID
- `repoPath` (required): Absolute file system path to the local git repository
- `branch` (required): Branch name to push to remote

```
polygraph_push_branch(
  sessionId: "<session-id>",
  repoPath: "/path/to/cloned/repo",
  branch: "polygraph/ad5fa-add-user-preferences"
)
```

### 3. Create Draft PRs

Create PRs for all repositories at once using `polygraph_create_prs`. PRs are created as drafts with session metadata that links related PRs across repos. Branches must be pushed first.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID
- `prs` (required): Array of PR specifications, each containing:
  - `owner` (required): GitHub repository owner
  - `repo` (required): GitHub repository name
  - `title` (required): PR title
  - `body` (required): PR description (session metadata is appended automatically)
  - `branch` (required): Branch name that was pushed
- `plan` (required): High-level plan describing the session's purpose. Both `plan` and `agentSessionId` must always be provided together to enable session resuming.
- `agentSessionId` (required): The Claude CLI session ID. Both `plan` and `agentSessionId` must always be provided together to enable session resuming.

```
polygraph_create_prs(
  sessionId: "<session-id>",
  plan: "Add user preferences feature: UI in frontend, API in backend",
  agentSessionId: "<claude-session-id>",
  prs: [
    {
      owner: "org",
      repo: "frontend",
      title: "feat: Add user preferences UI",
      body: "Part of multi-repo user preferences feature",
      branch: "polygraph/ad5fa-add-user-preferences"
    },
    {
      owner: "org",
      repo: "backend",
      title: "feat: Add user preferences API",
      body: "Part of multi-repo user preferences feature",
      branch: "polygraph/ad5fa-add-user-preferences"
    }
  ]
)
```

**After creating PRs**, always print the Polygraph session URL:

```
**Polygraph session:** POLYGRAPH_SESSION_URL
```

### 4. Get Current Polygraph Session

Check the status of a session using `polygraph_get_session`. Returns the full session state including workspaces, PRs, CI status, and the Polygraph session URL.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID

**Returns:**

- `session.sessionId`: The session ID
- `session.polygraphSessionUrl`: URL to the Polygraph session UI
- `session.plan`: High-level plan describing what this session is doing (null if not set)
- `session.agentSessionId`: The Claude CLI session ID that can be used to resume the session (null if not set)
- `session.workspaces[]`: Array of connected workspaces, each with:
  - `id`: Workspace ID
  - `name`: Workspace name
  - `defaultBranch`: Default branch (e.g., `main`)
  - `vcsConfiguration.repositoryFullName`: Full repo name (e.g., `org/repo`)
  - `vcsConfiguration.provider`: VCS provider (e.g., `GITHUB`)
  - `workspaceDescription`: AI-generated description of what this workspace does (may be null)
  - `initiator`: Whether this workspace initiated the session
- `session.dependencyGraph`: Graph of workspace dependency `edges`
- `session.pullRequests[]`: Array of PRs, each with:
  - `url`: PR URL
  - `branch`: Branch name
  - `baseBranch`: Target branch
  - `title`: PR title
  - `status`: One of `DRAFT`, `OPEN`, `MERGED`, `CLOSED`
  - `workspaceId`: Associated workspace ID
  - `relatedPRs`: Array of related PR URLs across repos
- `session.ciStatus`: CI pipeline status keyed by PR ID, each containing:
  - `status`: One of `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `NOT_STARTED` (null if no CIPE and no external CI)
  - `cipeUrl`: URL to the CI pipeline execution details (null if no CIPE)
  - `completedAt`: Epoch millis timestamp, set only when the CIPE has completed (null otherwise)
  - `selfHealingStatus`: The self-healing fix status string from Nx Cloud's AI fix feature (null if no AI fix exists)
  - `externalCIRuns`: Array of external CI runs (present when no CIPE but external CI data exists, e.g., GitHub Actions). Each run contains:
    - `runId`: GitHub Actions run ID
    - `name`: Workflow name
    - `status`: Run status (`completed`, `in_progress`, `queued`)
    - `conclusion`: Run conclusion (`success`, `failure`, `cancelled`, `timed_out`, or null)
    - `url`: GitHub Actions run URL
    - `jobs`: Array of jobs in the run, each with:
      - `jobId`: Job ID (use with `ci_get_logs`)
      - `name`: Job name
      - `status`: Job status
      - `conclusion`: Job conclusion (or null)

```
polygraph_get_session(sessionId: "<session-id>")
```

### 5. Mark PRs Ready

Once all changes are verified and ready to merge, use `polygraph_mark_ready` to transition PRs from DRAFT to OPEN status.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID
- `prUrls` (required): Array of PR URLs to mark as ready for review
- `plan` (required): High-level plan describing the session's purpose. Both `plan` and `agentSessionId` must always be provided together to enable session resuming.
- `agentSessionId` (required): The Claude CLI session ID. Both `plan` and `agentSessionId` must always be provided together to enable session resuming.

```
polygraph_mark_ready(
  sessionId: "<session-id>",
  plan: "Add user preferences feature: UI in frontend, API in backend",
  agentSessionId: "<claude-session-id>",
  prUrls: [
    "https://github.com/org/frontend/pull/123",
    "https://github.com/org/backend/pull/456"
  ]
)
```

**After marking PRs as ready**, always print the Polygraph session URL so the user can easily access the session overview. Call `polygraph_get_session` and display:

```
**Polygraph session:** POLYGRAPH_SESSION_URL
```

Where `POLYGRAPH_SESSION_URL` is from `polygraphSessionUrl` in the response.

### 6. Associate Existing PRs

Use `polygraph_associate_pr` to link pull requests that were created outside of Polygraph (e.g., manually or by CI) to the current session. This is useful when PRs already exist for the branches in the session and you want Polygraph to track them.

Provide either a `prUrl` to associate a specific PR, or a `branch` name to find and associate PRs matching that branch across session workspaces.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID
- `prUrl` (optional): URL of an existing pull request to associate
- `branch` (optional): Branch name to find and associate PRs for
- `plan` (required): High-level plan describing the session's purpose. Both `plan` and `agentSessionId` must always be provided together to enable session resuming.
- `agentSessionId` (required): The Claude CLI session ID. Both `plan` and `agentSessionId` must always be provided together to enable session resuming.

```
polygraph_associate_pr(
  sessionId: "<session-id>",
  plan: "Add user preferences feature: UI in frontend, API in backend",
  agentSessionId: "<claude-session-id>",
  prUrl: "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"
)
```

Or by branch:

```
polygraph_associate_pr(
  sessionId: "<session-id>",
  plan: "Add user preferences feature: UI in frontend, API in backend",
  agentSessionId: "<claude-session-id>",
  branch: "feature/my-changes"
)
```

**Returns** the list of PRs now associated with the session.

### 7. Complete Session

**IMPORTANT: Only call this tool when the user explicitly asks to complete or close the session.** Do not automatically complete sessions as part of the workflow.

**⚠️ Warning:** Completing a session is a **destructive action**. It will close all associated open and draft PRs. Only complete a session when the user explicitly confirms they want to close all PRs and seal the session.

Use `polygraph_modify_session` with `complete: true` to mark the session as completed. Completing a session will:

- **Mark the session as completed** and sealed from further modifications (no new PRs, status changes, etc.)
- **Close all open and draft PRs** associated with the session
- Return a `closedPRs` list in the response showing which PRs were closed and whether each close succeeded

This is idempotent — completing an already-completed session returns success.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID

**Returns:**

- `sessionId`: The session ID
- `completed`: Boolean indicating completion status
- `closedPRs`: Array of objects for each PR that was closed, each containing:
  - `url`: The PR URL
  - `success`: Boolean indicating whether the close succeeded
  - `error` (optional): Error message if the close failed

```
polygraph_modify_session(
  sessionId: "<session-id>",
  complete: true
)
```

**When to call:**

- After all cross-repo work is finished
- All PRs have been created and marked ready for review
- The user explicitly confirms they want to close all PRs and seal the session

## Other Capabilities

### Retrieving CI Job Logs

Use `ci_get_logs` to retrieve the full plain-text log for a specific CI job. This is the drill-in tool for investigating CI failures after identifying a failed job from the session's CI status.

**ONLY use this tool when NO CIPE (CI Pipeline Execution) exists for the PR.** When a CIPE exists (`ciStatus[prId].cipeUrl` is non-null), logs and failure data are available through the CIPE system (Nx Cloud) via `ci_information` — do NOT call `ci_get_logs`. This tool is specifically for PRs where only external CI runs exist (e.g., GitHub Actions runs without an Nx Cloud CIPE).

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): The Polygraph session ID
- `workspaceId` (required): Nx Cloud workspace ID (MongoDB ObjectId hex string, from `session.workspaces[].id`)
- `jobId` (required): GitHub Actions job ID (from `ciStatus[prId].externalCIRuns[].jobs[].jobId` in the `get_session` response)

**Returns:**

- On success: `{ success: true, jobId: number, logFile: string, sizeBytes: number }`
- On failure: `{ success: false, error: string }`

The tool saves the log to a local temp file and returns the path in `logFile`. Use the `Read` tool to examine the file contents. For large logs, use `offset` and `limit` parameters to read specific sections.

```
ci_get_logs(
  sessionId: "<session-id>",
  workspaceId: "<workspace-id>",
  jobId: 12345678
)
// Returns: { success: true, jobId: 12345678, logFile: "/tmp/ci-logs/job-12345678.log", sizeBytes: 152340 }
// Then: Read(logFile) to examine the log
```

**Typical flow:**

1. Use `polygraph_get_session` to see PR CI status
2. Check `ciStatus[prId].cipeUrl` — if a CIPE exists, use `ci_information` for logs and skip this tool
3. If NO CIPE exists, check `ciStatus[prId].externalCIRuns` — examine runs and jobs directly from the session data
4. For a failed job, call `ci_get_logs(sessionId, workspaceId, jobId)` to save the log to a file
5. Use `Read(logFile)` to examine the log content — use `offset`/`limit` for large files

**Important:** Logs can be large (100KB+). Only fetch logs for failed or relevant jobs, and read only the sections you need.

### Session State for Resume (Required)

The `plan` and `agentSessionId` parameters are **required** on `polygraph_create_prs`, `polygraph_mark_ready`, and `polygraph_associate_pr`. You must always provide both values together. They save session state that enables resuming the Polygraph session later.

- **`plan`**: A high-level description of what this session is doing (e.g., "Add user preferences feature across frontend and backend repos"). This helps anyone resuming the session understand the context.
- **`agentSessionId`**: The Claude CLI session ID for the parent agent. This is the session ID that can be passed to `claude --continue` to resume exactly where the agent left off.

These fields are saved to the Polygraph session server-side and are available from `polygraph_get_session`. The Polygraph UI also shows a "Resume Session" section with copy-able commands when these fields are present.

### Resuming a Polygraph Session

If a session has a saved `agentSessionId`, it can be resumed using:

```
claude --continue <agentSessionId>
```

This resumes the Claude CLI session that was coordinating the Polygraph work, restoring the full conversation context including which repos were involved, what work was delegated, and what remains to be done.

To check if a session is resumable, call `polygraph_get_session` and look for the `agentSessionId` field in the response.

### Print Polygraph Session Details

When asked to print polygraph session details, use `polygraph_get_session` and display in the following format:

**Session:** POLYGRAPH_SESSION_URL

| Repo           | PR                 | PR Status | CI Status | Self-Healing        | CI Link          |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------- | --------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| REPO_FULL_NAME | [PR_TITLE](PR_URL) | PR_STATUS | CI_STATUS | SELF_HEALING_STATUS | [View](CIPE_URL) |

If the session has a `plan` or `agentSessionId`, also display:

**Plan:** SESSION_PLAN

**Resume:** `claude --continue AGENT_SESSION_ID`

(Omit the Plan line if `plan` is null. Omit the Resume line if `agentSessionId` is null.)

**Local paths:**

- REPO_FULL_NAME: LOCAL_PATH

- REPO_FULL_NAME: from `workspaces[].vcsConfiguration.repositoryFullName` (match workspace to PR via `workspaceId`)
- LOCAL_PATH: the absolute path to the local clone of the repo. If you started the session from within a repo, that repo's path is the current working directory. All other repos' paths are available from `polygraph_child_status`.
- PR_URL, PR_TITLE, PR_STATUS: from `pullRequests[]`
- CI_STATUS: from `ciStatus[prId].status`
- SELF_HEALING_STATUS: from `ciStatus[prId].selfHealingStatus` (omit or show `-` if null)
- CIPE_URL: from `ciStatus[prId].cipeUrl`
- POLYGRAPH_SESSION_URL: from `polygraphSessionUrl`
- SESSION_PLAN: from `plan`
- AGENT_SESSION_ID: from `agentSessionId`

## Best Practices

{%- if platform == "claude" %}

1. **Test integration** before marking PRs ready
