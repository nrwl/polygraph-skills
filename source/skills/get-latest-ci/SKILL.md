# Get Latest CI Information

Fetch the latest CI pipeline execution for the current branch. This is a **one-shot fetch** — return results immediately. Do NOT poll, loop, or wait for status changes.

## Context

- **Current Branch:** !`git branch --show-current`
- **Current Commit:** !`git rev-parse --short HEAD`

## Step 1: Fetch CI Status via Subagent

{% if platform == "claude" %}

Spawn a `general-purpose` subagent using the Task tool. The subagent will call the MCP tool and return results. Do NOT attempt to fetch CI information yourself — always delegate to the subagent.

{% raw %}

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Fetch latest CI status",
  prompt: "Fetch the latest CI pipeline execution status. Do NOT use Bash for this.

    Use the ci_information tool from the nx MCP server with these parameters:
      select: 'cipeStatus,cipeUrl,branch,commitSha,selfHealingStatus,verificationStatus,userAction,failedTaskIds,verifiedTaskIds,selfHealingEnabled,failureClassification,couldAutoApplyTasks,shortLink,confidence,confidenceReasoning,hints'

    Return ALL fields from the response as-is. Do not summarize or omit any fields.

    If cipeStatus is FAILED and selfHealingStatus is COMPLETED or FAILED and there are failedTaskIds, make a SECOND call to the same tool with:
      select: 'taskOutputSummary,suggestedFix,suggestedFixReasoning,suggestedFixDescription'

    Return those fields too. Only return the first page — do not paginate."
)
```

{% endraw %}
{% elsif platform == "codex" %}

Use a Codex built-in subagent to call the MCP tool and return results. Do NOT attempt to fetch CI information in the main conversation — delegate it so the MCP payload stays isolated.

{% raw %}

```
spawn_agent(
  agent_type: "default",
  message: "Fetch the latest CI pipeline execution status. Do NOT use shell commands for this.

    Use the ci_information tool from the nx MCP server with these parameters:
      select: 'cipeStatus,cipeUrl,branch,commitSha,selfHealingStatus,verificationStatus,userAction,failedTaskIds,verifiedTaskIds,selfHealingEnabled,failureClassification,couldAutoApplyTasks,shortLink,confidence,confidenceReasoning,hints'

    Return ALL fields from the response as-is. Do not summarize or omit any fields.

    If cipeStatus is FAILED and selfHealingStatus is COMPLETED or FAILED and there are failedTaskIds, make a SECOND call to the same tool with:
      select: 'taskOutputSummary,suggestedFix,suggestedFixReasoning,suggestedFixDescription'

    Return those fields too. Only return the first page — do not paginate."
)
```

{% endraw %}

Collect the result with `wait_agent` when you need to report it.
{% else %}

Call the `ci_information` tool from the nx MCP server with these parameters:

{% raw %}

```yaml
select: 'cipeStatus,cipeUrl,branch,commitSha,selfHealingStatus,verificationStatus,userAction,failedTaskIds,verifiedTaskIds,selfHealingEnabled,failureClassification,couldAutoApplyTasks,shortLink,confidence,confidenceReasoning,hints'
```

{% endraw %}

If `cipeStatus` is `FAILED` and `selfHealingStatus` is `COMPLETED` or `FAILED` and there are `failedTaskIds`, make a second call with:

{% raw %}

```yaml
select: 'taskOutputSummary,suggestedFix,suggestedFixReasoning,suggestedFixDescription'
```

{% endraw %}

Only return the first page — do not paginate.
{% endif %}

## Step 2: Report Results

Based on the subagent's response, report to the user. Always include the CIPE URL when available.

If the response contains a non-empty `hints` array, include those hints in the output to the user.

### No CIPE found (null/empty response)

```
[get-latest-ci] No CI pipeline execution found for branch '<branch>'.
```

### CI Succeeded

```
[get-latest-ci] CI passed!
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Commit: <commitSha>
```

### CI In Progress / Not Started

```
[get-latest-ci] CI is <IN_PROGRESS|NOT_STARTED>.
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Commit: <commitSha>
```

If self-healing is also in progress, add:

```
[get-latest-ci] Self-healing: <selfHealingStatus> | Verification: <verificationStatus>
```

### CI Failed — With Self-Healing Fix Available

When `cipeStatus == 'FAILED'` AND `selfHealingStatus == 'COMPLETED'` AND `suggestedFix != null`:

```
[get-latest-ci] CI failed.
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Commit: <commitSha>
[get-latest-ci] Failed tasks: <failedTaskIds>
[get-latest-ci]
[get-latest-ci] Self-healing fix available!
[get-latest-ci] Short link: <shortLink>
[get-latest-ci] Confidence: <confidence> — <confidenceReasoning>
[get-latest-ci] Verification: <verificationStatus>
[get-latest-ci] Auto-apply eligible: <couldAutoApplyTasks>
[get-latest-ci]
[get-latest-ci] Fix description: <suggestedFixDescription>
[get-latest-ci] Fix reasoning: <suggestedFixReasoning> (truncated to first page)
```

### CI Failed — Self-Healing In Progress

When `cipeStatus == 'FAILED'` AND `selfHealingStatus == 'IN_PROGRESS'`:

```
[get-latest-ci] CI failed. Self-healing is generating a fix...
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Commit: <commitSha>
[get-latest-ci] Failed tasks: <failedTaskIds>
[get-latest-ci]
[get-latest-ci] Use /monitor-ci to wait for the fix and apply it.
```

### CI Failed — Self-Healing Failed or Not Available

When `cipeStatus == 'FAILED'` AND (`selfHealingStatus` is `FAILED`, `NOT_EXECUTABLE`, or `null`):

```
[get-latest-ci] CI failed.
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Commit: <commitSha>
[get-latest-ci] Failed tasks: <failedTaskIds>
[get-latest-ci] Self-healing: <selfHealingStatus or "not available">
[get-latest-ci] Classification: <failureClassification>
```

If `taskOutputSummary` was fetched, include a brief summary of failures.

### CI Failed — Environment Issue

When `failureClassification == 'ENVIRONMENT_STATE'`:

```
[get-latest-ci] CI failed due to environment issue.
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Classification: ENVIRONMENT_STATE
[get-latest-ci]
[get-latest-ci] Use /monitor-ci to request an environment rerun.
```

### CI Canceled / Timed Out

```
[get-latest-ci] CI was <CANCELED|TIMED_OUT>.
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Commit: <commitSha>
```

### CI Failed — No Tasks Recorded

When `cipeStatus == 'FAILED'` AND `failedTaskIds` is empty AND `selfHealingStatus` is null:

```
[get-latest-ci] CI failed but no Nx tasks were recorded (likely infrastructure issue).
[get-latest-ci] URL: <cipeUrl>
[get-latest-ci] Check CI provider logs for details.
```

## Important

- This skill is **read-only**. Do NOT apply fixes, push code, or modify anything.
{% if platform == "claude" %}
- Always delegate the MCP call to a subagent. Do NOT call ci_information yourself.
{% elsif platform == "codex" %}
- Always delegate the MCP call to a Codex built-in subagent. Do NOT call ci_information yourself in the main conversation.
{% endif %}
- If the user wants to act on the results (apply a fix, monitor, etc.), suggest `/monitor-ci`.
- If the subagent returns an error, report it and suggest the user check their Nx Cloud connection.
